# A Note on the Motors

I use used Sanyo-Denki motors in this build, which come with 17-tooth 2mm pitch pulleys preinstalled.  They're very similar to these:

You can find other similar motors being sold used on eBay, with the pulleys included.  Some have the heat sinks, some do not (mine don't).

You can use a nutsplitter to remove the pulleys from the motors where you don't need them, or get different motors for Z and E axis, or use pulleys and motors you have purchased separately, but keep in mind you'll have to change the motor_pulley_d to suit your own pulleys in vars.scad.
